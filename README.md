_Why did I even bother doing this._

## ðŸ’¾ Installation
It is recommended to run this with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). You can also run with Node.js >8.x but it is not recommended for production use.  
If using Docker, you can either build the image yourself from this repo, or pull the `lolpants/fbaas` image.
